This project contains the code I use for explanatory math videos and shorts found on my math review channel [Tired Undergrad](https://www.youtube.com/@tiredundergrad), and my mathematics education channel [Kris Pedagogy]().

This entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/). 

Older projects may have code dependant on older versions of manimm, and so may not run out of the box here. 

Note: the manim library linked above is open source but the content here is specifically for videos on krisyotam. You are free to however analyze 
it and take pieces of the code where needed.
